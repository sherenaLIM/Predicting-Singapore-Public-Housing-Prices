    "\n",
    "Over the years, Singapore has seen the puzzling rise of public housing in the resale market with million dollar price tags, supporting the theory that ‚Äúdecent gains‚Äù can still be acquired, especially for HDB flats bought at subsidised prices from the Government. What are the factors contributing to high upside potential for these units? \n",
    "\n",
    "Research Findings: Property value is affected by the confluence of macro and micro, demand and supply factors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<details><summary> (1) Demand-pull inflation caused by shifts in socio-demographic micro-trends. </summary>\n",
    "- Many young couples are willing to pay a premium to acquire a resale flat to avoid delaying plans to start a family. \n",
    "- More millenials are also opting to remain single and aspire to move out of their nests before they are eligible to purchase a BTO, to alleviate the strain on relationships and their mental health. Covid-19 has likely accelerated the desire to move out for many millenials.\n",
    "- In response to these socio-demographic trends, the government is rethinking the 35 year-old age requirement for single Singaporeans. could elevate the demand for resale flats even further. \n",
    "- Based on a study conducted by the Ministry of Finance, Singaporeans' education, employment, wage outcomes have improved over the generations. Many are gainfully employed, as reflected in the high proportion of Singapore citizens in employment and the low unemployment rate.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "<br> \n",
    "<details><summary> (2) Demand-pull inflation in the private housing market. </summary>\n",
    "- Historical data on private property housing has shown that while sales volume and prices usually dip during a crisis such as a high inflation, high interest rate environment, it has not been the case for the private housing market in Singapore. More wealthy individuals from China and Hong Kong are moving into the Singapore private property market to escape XJP's common prosperity doctrine. This will drive the prices of private condominiums even higher, making it less affordable for many middle income Singaporeans. Being priced out of the private housing market, this substantial group of consumers will turn to the next best alternative - spacious resale flats. Demand for resale flats is projected to increase even more, driving resale prices even higher. \n",
    "</details>\n",
    "<br> \n",
    "<details><summary> (3) Material cost-push inflation due to supply-chain disruptions, increasing costs of production. </summary>\n",
    "- Supply disruptions from the Russia-Ukraine war and ongoing supply chain issues caused prices of core construction materials in Singapore, such as copper, steel, concrete, cement and bricks, to inflate and material costs are projected to remain elevated in the next few quarters. \n",
    "- Costs of production has yet to be offset by increasing productivity as digitalisation of the construction workforce is not an overnight process.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<details><summary> (4) Material cost-push inflation compounded by high-interest rates. </summary>\n",
    "- As FEDs are resolute in their fight against inflation, businesses suffer amidst hawkish quantitative tightening (contractionary monetary policy). High interest rates reduce the developer‚Äôs ability to service debt, as rising costs are incurred by the organization with no corresponding increase in revenues to offset while the construction is on-going.\n",
    "- These costs are likely to be passed on to home-buyers. \n",

    "You are part of the Research & Consultancy team in PropNext. Propnext would like to ride on the wave and increase the number of high-value sales and purchase transactions intermediated by PropNext agents. PropNext is looking to develop an in-house mobile application that is able to predict the selling price of HDB resale flats. The application would help real estate agents detect and look out for units with huge upside potential, so as to rake in higher commissions per sale. The team has to identify high-yield features that contribute to the appreciation of units and report their findings to the software development team in 2 weeks' time. The software developers will then communicate the requirements to the software engineers who would then build the application with the embedded predictive function in collaboration with data scientists.

    "2. Do you feel that this model will generalize to other cities? How could you revise your model to make it more universal OR what date would you need from another city to make a comparable model? \n",
    "> * This model is unlikely to generalize to other cities. Singapore's housing market is very uniquely different from that of other countries. This is largely due to the Government's commitment to the people that they will do what is necessary to ensure affordable public housing for all Singaporeans. Home ownership for all Singaporeans in a key national policy. \n",
    "> * That saying, some might argue that this model could generalize well to housing data in China as government intervention in the housing market is prevalent there as well. While both governments enact public housing policies extensively to achieve similar aims ‚Äì essentially, to provide affordable housing for its residents ‚Äì there is still a significant contrast with the state of Singapore‚Äôs public housing market vis-a-vis China. Singapore's focus upholding housing policy regulations lends the local housing market an element of predictability. In contrast, the housing market in China is predicated on inadequate regulations and financed by weak state-owned banks, therefore highly volatile and susceptible to trasitory external and internal shocks. \n",
    "> * Today, evidence suggests that Singapore's property prices are continuing to grow despite a cooling off in other parts of the world. This also suggests that price trends are likely to deviate consistently from that in other countries due to systemic / structural differences. "
